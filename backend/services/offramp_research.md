## Research Findings:





### 1. Stellar Anchor Platform (SEP-24 / SEP-31)

*   **Description:** Stellar provides standardized protocols (SEPs) for on/off-ramps. SEP-24 is for interactive, hosted deposit/withdrawal, while SEP-31 is for cross-border payments. Anchors are entities that connect Stellar to traditional banking.
*   **Geographic Coverage:** Depends on the specific anchor. Many anchors operate in various African countries (e.g., ClickPesa, Cowrie, Flutterwave (also an anchor), Paychant).
*   **Payout Methods:** Bank transfers, mobile money (via specific anchors).
*   **API Availability:** Yes, SEPs define the API interactions. The Anchor Platform helps deploy SEP-compliant services.
*   **Fees and FX Rates:** Varies by anchor. SEP-38 allows for RFQ (Request for Quote) to get firm quotes.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Anchors are responsible for their own compliance and KYC/AML according to their jurisdiction.
*   **Reliability and Scalability:** The Stellar network itself is scalable. Anchor reliability depends on the individual anchor.
*   **Developer Experience:** Good, with clear SEP documentation and tools like the Anchor Platform.
*   **Settlement Times:** Varies by anchor and payout method.
*   **USDC Support:** Yes, Stellar supports USDC (typically as a Stellar asset issued by Circle or other entities).
*   **Key SEPs for Off-Ramp:**
    *   **SEP-24 (Interactive Anchor/Wallet Withdrawals):** User is redirected to an anchor's web interface to complete withdrawal. Anchor handles KYC.
    *   **SEP-31 (Cross-Border Payments):** Designed for businesses sending payments. Requires more direct integration and often bilateral agreements. Anchor handles KYC of the *receiving* customer.
    *   **SEP-6 (Programmatic Deposit/Withdrawal):** Wallet collects KYC and interacts directly with anchor APIs. Less common for pure off-ramps due to KYC burden on wallets.
    *   **SEP-12 (KYC API):** Standard for wallets to provide KYC info to anchors if needed (more relevant for SEP-6).
    *   **SEP-38 (Anchor RFQ API):** Allows getting a firm quote for currency conversion before initiating a transaction.

*   **Conclusion for RemitAI:** Promising, especially if leveraging existing anchors in target countries. SEP-24 seems most suitable for user-initiated withdrawals. Requires identifying and integrating with specific anchors. Could offer a decentralized and potentially lower-cost option if good anchors are available.



### 2. M-Pesa API (Safaricom Daraja API)

*   **Description:** M-Pesa is a dominant mobile money service in East Africa, particularly Kenya. Safaricom provides the Daraja API for developers to integrate with M-Pesa services.
*   **Geographic Coverage:** Primarily Kenya, with presence in Tanzania (Vodacom M-Pesa), Mozambique, DRC, Lesotho, Ghana, and Egypt. Direct API integration is typically country-specific (e.g., Safaricom for Kenya).
*   **Payout Methods:** Direct to M-Pesa mobile wallets.
*   **API Availability:** Yes, Safaricom offers the Daraja API. It includes various functionalities like Business to Customer (B2C) payments, which is relevant for off-ramping.
*   **Fees and FX Rates:** Transaction fees apply as per Safaricom's M-Pesa tariffs. FX conversion would typically happen before initiating an M-Pesa payout if the source is not KES.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Safaricom is a regulated entity. Businesses integrating would need to comply with Safaricom's terms and local regulations, including KYC/AML for their own services.
*   **Reliability and Scalability:** M-Pesa is a highly reliable and scalable platform within its operating countries.
*   **Developer Experience:** Safaricom provides a developer portal with API documentation and sandbox environments. Integration can be complex due to specific security requirements and approval processes.
*   **Settlement Times:** Payouts to M-Pesa wallets are typically instant or near-instant once processed.
*   **USDC Support:** No direct USDC support within M-Pesa itself. Conversion from USDC to KES (or other local currency) would need to happen via an exchange or liquidity provider before initiating an M-Pesa B2C payout.

*   **Conclusion for RemitAI:** A strong candidate for off-ramping in Kenya and other M-Pesa dominant countries. The primary challenge is the USDC to local currency conversion step, which would need to be handled by RemitAI or a partner before using the M-Pesa API for the final payout. Direct integration with Daraja API is feasible for B2C payouts.



### 3. MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) API

*   **Description:** MTN is a major telecommunications provider across Africa, and its Mobile Money (MoMo) service is widely used. MTN provides the MoMo API for developers to integrate various financial services.
*   **Geographic Coverage:** Extensive coverage in many African countries where MTN operates (e.g., Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Benin, Rwanda, Zambia, etc.).
*   **Payout Methods:** Direct to MTN MoMo wallets.
*   **API Availability:** Yes, MTN offers the MoMo Developer Portal with API documentation (e.g., for Collections, Disbursements, Remittances).
*   **Fees and FX Rates:** Transaction fees are applicable as per MTN MoMo tariffs for the specific country. FX conversion from USDC to local currency would need to be handled externally before initiating a MoMo payout.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** MTN is a regulated entity in its countries of operation. Integrating businesses must comply with MTNâ€™s terms and local financial regulations.
*   **Reliability and Scalability:** MTN MoMo is generally a reliable and scalable platform within its operational countries.
*   **Developer Experience:** MTN provides a developer portal with API documentation, SDKs (e.g., Java, PHP, Python), and a sandbox environment. Integration complexity can vary by country and specific API product.
*   **Settlement Times:** Payouts to MoMo wallets are typically instant or near-instant.
*   **USDC Support:** No direct USDC support within the MoMo API. Conversion from USDC to local currency is a prerequisite for using the API for fiat payouts.

*   **Conclusion for RemitAI:** A strong candidate for off-ramping in countries with high MTN MoMo penetration. Similar to M-Pesa, the main challenge is the USDC to local currency conversion step, which RemitAI or a partner would need to manage before using the MoMo API for the final disbursement. The Disbursements API product would be relevant here.

## Overall Conclusion and Recommended Strategy for RemitAI Off-Ramp:

After reviewing the available options, a hybrid approach is recommended for RemitAI to achieve broad coverage and flexibility:

1.  **Primary Recommendation: Flutterwave.**
    *   **Reasoning:** Flutterwave offers the broadest geographical coverage across Africa, supports a wide array of payout methods (bank, mobile money), and is actively moving towards direct USDC support through its partnership with Circle. This aligns well with RemitAI's need to off-ramp USDC directly to local fiat currencies.
    *   **Implementation:** Prioritize integration with Flutterwave's Transfers API, and monitor their USDC off-ramp capabilities as they become available.

2.  **Secondary/Complementary Options:**
    *   **Stellar Anchor Platform (SEP-24):** For specific corridors where well-established and cost-effective Stellar anchors exist, SEP-24 integration can provide a decentralized and potentially lower-cost alternative. This would require identifying and vetting individual anchors.
    *   **Direct Mobile Money APIs (M-Pesa, MTN MoMo):** In countries where these services are dominant and Flutterwave might have gaps or less competitive rates, direct integration could be considered. However, this adds complexity due to managing multiple direct integrations and handling USDC-to-fiat conversion separately for each.
    *   **Paystack:** A strong alternative to Flutterwave in its core markets (Nigeria, Ghana, SA) if Flutterwave integration faces challenges or for diversification.

3.  **Mock Implementation First:** For initial development and testing, a mock off-ramp service will be implemented. This mock service will simulate interactions with a provider like Flutterwave, allowing the frontend and core logic to be built and tested independently of live API integrations.

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement a mock `OffRampService` in Python, mirroring the structure of the `OnRampService`.
*   This service will simulate initiating a withdrawal (USDC to Fiat), checking status, and providing mock payout details.
*   Once the core application logic is stable, proceed with integrating a live API, starting with Flutterwave (or its sandbox environment if available for USDC off-ramping).
